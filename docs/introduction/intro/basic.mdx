| Entity            | **Entity represents your user (Jessica or John)** and all accounts that belong to a specific user will have the same entity ID. 
| Accounts          | **Accounts represent the link formed when your users connect their accounts (GitHub, Shopify, etc.) to your app**. 
| Apps              | **Apps refer to the applications** that can be **connected by your users**. 
| Actions           | **Actions are tasks** on top of tools that you can perform using accounts. (Send a mail using Gmail tool) 
| Triggers          | **Triggers are predefined conditions** that, when met, initiate webhooks to your agents. (When a mail is received in a Gmail account, send a webhook)
| Integrations      | **Configuration objects that define how your application connects to external services**, including OAuth credentials, permission scopes, and API specifications. They serve as reusable templates for standardizing authentication flows.
