## What is Composio?

Composio helps you connect AI agents to external tools like Gmail, GitHub, Salesforce, etc. It's like a bridge between your AI and the tools it needs to get work done.

Here's what you can do:
- **Seamless Connections:** Connect AI Agents to tools like Gmail, GitHub, Salesforce & local tools such as File tool, Shell tool, etc.
- **Authentication Mechanisms:** Support industry-standard auth protocols (OAuth, API Keys, JWT) with built-in security best practices, automatic token refresh handling, and secure user account connections - all without handling sensitive credentials
- **Language Agnostic:** Integrate with any programming language through our API-first approach
- **Managed Execution Environments:** Run tools in managed execution environments - Docker, E2B, Fly.io, Lambda, etc.
- **Full Visibility:** Inspect every function called by the LLM, track timestamps for each Execution, and more.
